Suggested Improvements
Security Enhancements:

Currently, any data can be QR-encoded without validation or encryption
No digital signatures are used to verify QR code authenticity
No rate limiting on QR code generation/scanning
QR Code Customization:

Limited options for QR code format, error correction, size, and colors
No branding options (like embedded logos)
Integration Limitations:

No direct scanning functionality in the API
Limited connection to the products system
No dynamic QR code content (all static)

Missing Features:

No analytics for QR code scans
No expiring/temporary QR codes
No batch QR code generation
Specific Improvement Recommendations
Enhanced Security:

Add digital signatures to QR codes to prevent counterfeiting
Implement encryption for sensitive data
Add verification endpoints to validate QR code authenticity
Better Product Integration:

Create specific DTOs for QR code data structures
Add a direct endpoint to generate QR codes for products with verification URLs
Implement a scan endpoint that returns complete product details

Advanced QR Features:

Support for dynamic QR codes that can be updated without changing the code itself
Add options for error correction levels, sizes, and colors
Support for embedding logos in QR codes
Analytics and Tracking:

Track QR code scans with location and timestamp data
Generate analytics reports on QR code usage
Implement scan limits or expiration for QR codes
Performance Optimizations:

Add caching for frequently scanned QR codes
Optimize QR code image generation and storage

Improved Error Handling:

More specific error types for QR code generation/scanning failures
Better validation of input data before QR code generation
