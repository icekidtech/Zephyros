 Enhance DTO Usage
Populate the dto folders in modules like auth, users, and products with Data Transfer Objects (DTOs) for input validation and data structuring. Use class-validator and class-transformer for validation.
2. Centralize Configuration
Use the @nestjs/config module to centralize environment variables and configuration. Create a config folder with files for different configurations (e.g., database.config.ts, auth.config.ts).
3. Error Handling
Implement a global exception filter in the common folder to handle errors consistently across the application.
4. Logging Enhancements
Expand the logging module to include structured logging (e.g., using winston or pino) and log levels (info, error, debug).
5. Swagger Documentation
Add detailed Swagger decorators (@ApiTags, @ApiOperation, @ApiResponse) to controllers for better API documentation.
6. Testing
Add unit tests for services and controllers in each module. Use Jest for mocking dependencies and testing business logic.
7. Role-Based Access Control
Refactor the RolesGuard to use metadata decorators like @SetMetadata for cleaner role-based access control.
8. Database Indexing
Add indexes to frequently queried fields in Mongoose schemas (e.g., email in user.schema.ts) to improve query performance.
9. Code Consistency
Ensure consistent naming conventions across the codebase (e.g., use camelCase for variables and PascalCase for classes).
10. Folder Structure
Consider moving shared modules like auth, users, and organization into a modules folder for better organization.
11. Environment-Specific Configurations
Use .env files for environment-specific configurations (e.g., .env.development, .env.production) and load them using dotenv.
12. Middleware
Add middleware for common tasks like request logging, rate limiting, or CORS handling.
13. CI/CD Integration
Add a CI/CD pipeline (e.g., GitHub Actions) to automate testing, linting, and deployment.
14. Code Quality
Add a linter (e.g., ESLint) and formatter (e.g., Prettier) to enforce code quality and style.
15. Health Checks
Add a health check endpoint (e.g., /health) to monitor the application's status.
